  <P style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">A bedroom or bedchamber is a room situated
    within a residential or accommodation unit characterised by its usage for sleeping and sexual activity. A typical
    western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture one or two beds (ranging from a crib for an infant, a single or twin
    bed for a toddler, child, teenager, or single adult to bigger sizes like a full, double, queen, king or California
    king [eastern or waterbed size for a couple]), a clothes closet, and bedside table and dressing table, both of
    which usually contain drawers. Except in bungalows, ranch style homes, ground floor apartments, or one-storey
    motels, bedrooms are usually on one of the floors of a dwelling that is above ground level</P>

  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Couch</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, or
    chesterfield, is a cushioned item of furniture for seating multiple people (although it is not uncommon for a single
    person to use a couch alone). It is commonly found in the form of a bench with upholstered armrests and is often
    fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows.[1][2] Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may
    be used for sleeping.[3] In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den, or lounge. They
    are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms,
    and bars. Couches can also vary in size, color, and design.</p>

  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Red Chair</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">The Red and Blue Chair is a chair designed in
    1917 by Gerrit Rietveld. It represents one of the first explorations by the De Stijl art movement in three
    dimensions. It features several Rietveld joints.

    The original chair was constructed of unstained beech wood and was not painted red, blue, yellow, and black until
    around 1923.[1][2] Fellow member of De Stijl and architect, Bart van der Leck, saw his original model and suggested
    that he add bright colours.[3] He built the new model of thinner wood and painted it entirely black with areas of
    primary colors attributed to De Stijl movement. The effect of this color scheme made the chair seem to almost
    disappear against the black walls and floor of the Rietveld Schr√∂der House, where it was later placed.[1] The areas
    of color appeared to float, giving it an almost transparent structure.[4]</p>

  </div>
  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Mattress Sofa</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">A mattress is a large, usually rectangular pad
    for supporting a lying person. It is designed to be used as a bed, or on a bed frame as part of a bed. Mattresses
    may consist of a quilted or similarly fastened case, usually of heavy cloth, containing materials such as hair,
    straw, cotton, foam rubber, or a framework of metal springs. Mattresses may also be filled with air or water.[1]

    Mattresses are usually placed on top of a bed base which may be solid, as in the case of a platform bed, or elastic,
    such as an upholstered wood and wire box spring or a slatted foundation. Popular in Europe, a divan[2] incorporates
    both mattress and foundation in a single upholstered, footed unit. Divans have at least one innerspring layer as
    well as cushioning materials.</p>

  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Dinner Set </h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">Dinner usually refers to what is in many Western
    cultures the largest and most formal meal of the day. Historically, the largest meal used to be eaten around midday,
    and called dinner.[1] Especially among the elite, it gradually migrated to later in the day over the 16th to 19th
    centuries.[2] The word has different meanings depending on culture, and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any
    time of day.[3] In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special
    occasions, such as a Christmas dinner.[2] In hot climates, the main meal is more likely to be eaten in the evening,
    after the temperature has fallen.</p>

    <h3>Drawing Room </h3>

  </div>
  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Drawing Room </h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">A drawing room is a room in a house where
    visitors may be entertained, and an alternative name for a living room. The name is derived from the 16th-century
    terms withdrawing room and withdrawing chamber, which remained in use through the 17th century, and made their first
    written appearance in 1642.[1] In a large 16th to early 18th century English house, a withdrawing room was a room to
    which the owner of the house, his wife, or a distinguished guest who was occupying one of the main apartments in the
    house could "withdraw" for more privacy. It was often off the great chamber (or the great chamber's descendant, the
    state room) and usually led to a formal, or "state" bedroom.[2]

    In modern houses, it may be used as a convenient name for a second or further reception room, but no particular
    function is associated with the name.</p>

  <h2 class="1co hover" style="text-align: center;">Dinning Table </h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">A dining room is a room for consuming food. In
    modern times it is usually adjacent to the kitchen for convenience in serving, although in medieval times it was
    often on an entirely different floor level. Historically the dining room is furnished with a rather large dining
    table and several dining chairs; the most common shape is generally rectangular with two armed end chairs and an
    even number of un-armed side chairs along the long sides.</p>
